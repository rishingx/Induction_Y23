# Solutions to Exercise Session 1

# Assumptions

The only two assumptions are that the system has docker installed and running on a X display server.

# Setting up the environment

Here we will download the ROS docker image, and make sure it is running properly. We will also configure a ROS container to our liking and create a custom image from this container. This new image will be our base going forward.

1. Pulling the ROS image

We will dowload the official ROS image - noetic distribution.

    docker pull ros:noetic-robot
    docker run ros:noetic-robot

If the above command works, we can now `exit` this container. We will spin up a new one for our configuration.

2. Forwarding the display ports

We will test various GUI applications inside our container (the *turtlesim* and *gazebo* packages), which require forwarding the calls to X server inside the container to the X server of our host machine.

    xhost +local:docker

Our `docker run` command also needs to be modified.

    docker run --name custom_ros -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix/ ros:noetic-robot bash

It should drop us inside a bash terminal within a `ros:noetic-robot` container named `custom_ros`. We can now start configuring our container.

3. Setting up the ROS container

Once inside our container, we will install a few example ROS tutorials, and run them to test out our container.

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-ros-tutorials

Next, we will source the ROS environment. The official docs encourage using the `ros_entrypoint.sh` script. However, this leads to an annoying bug where running a *bad* command immediately quits the container.

Instead we will directly source the requried file. The `ros_entrypoint.sh` script also does this but, indirectly.

    source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

We will also add it to our bashrc so that we don't have to repeat this commad every time we start our container.

    echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

4. Testing turtle simulator

To run the ROS master node, enter the following command.

    roscore

On another terminal window, type

    docker exec -it custom_ros bash

to create another bash session in the already running container `custom_ros`. Once in, we can run a turtle node, after sourcing our setup.

    source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
    rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

This should open a blue window containing a turtle icon in the middle. It means the display forwards, as well as the ROS container, both are working fine. At this point, we can also go ahead and test the talker-listner nodes as outlined in Lecture 1.

5. Creating a ROS Workspace

We will create a workspace for the catkin build system.

    mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    catkin_make

Next we will source the setup file generated by catkin, and also add it to our bashrc.

    source devel/setup.bash
    echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

6. Setting up git can catkin tools

We will now install two useful and essential tools

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    sudo apt install python3-catkin-tools

Once these are installed, our setup is complete and we can go ahead with the Lecture 1 up until Gazebo Simulator.
However, the Lecture prefers `catkin build` over `catkin_make`. So to avoid conflicts, we will need to remove the already made `build` and `devel` spaces.

    cd ~/catkin_ws/
    rm -rf build
    rm -rf devel

While building the `ros_package_template` or any other future package, we might run into missing dependencies. These can be checked beforehand too.

    rosdep check --from-paths ~/catkin_ws/src --ignore-src

7. Future use

Stopping the container, after `exit`.

    docker stop custom_ros

Restarting and entering into a bash session.

    docker start custom_ros
    docker exec -it custom_ros bash


# Solving the exercise

1. Setting up the SMB simulation

Before we begin the SMB simulation, we need to download the set of packages `smb_common`. We can do this by downloading it on the host machine, extracting and copying it into the container.

Once we have downloaded and extracted `smb_common.zip`, we can copy the folder `smb_common` into `custom_ros:/root/git` using the following.

    docker cp /path/to/smb_common custom_ros:/root/git/.

Next we create our workspace inside the container and create a symlink using,

    cd
    mkdir ~/Workspaces/smb_ws/src
    ln -s ~/git/smb_common/ ~/Workspaces/smb_ws/src/

Now, we can install the dependencies that `rosdep` finds using,

    rosdep check --from-paths ~/Workspaces/smb_ws/src --ignore-src

Unfortunate, in my case it could not find a package, leading to build errors down the line. I installed it using,

    sudo apt install ros-noetic-gazebo-plugins

Once all the dependencies are installed, we can go ahead and compile the `smb_gazebo` package using,

    cd ~/Workspaces/smb_ws/
    catkin build smb_gazebo
    source devel/setup.bash


2. Launching the simulation

We can now go ahead and launch the simulation.

    roslaunch smb_gazebo smb_gazebo.launch

3. Setting a velocity
4. Controlling the robot using keyboard
5. Writing a custom launch file
